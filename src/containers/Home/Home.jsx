            I'm currently pursuing my  <LinkRefer link="https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/applicants/mse-ap/index.html">Master of Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University</LinkRefer>,

            Before joining CMU, I was the Lead developer at Zerone Microsystems Private Limited, one of the four Indian startups selected for the Anthill Venturesâ€™ A- Scale program which was founded by the team of a former KPMG CEO and Partner.
            I worked on the core technology and led the development of several use - cases which included an

            <LinkRefer link="http://conyct.com"> identity exchange app</LinkRefer>, and
            <LinkRefer link="http://conyct.com/vms"> visitor management web and mobile application</LinkRefer>
            <br />
            <br />
            Through my Master's, I am trying to learn the fundamentals of software engineering and what it truly means to create a scalable system and manage the team and the life cycle of the product. My Courses include Managing Software Development, Models of Software Engineering
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from this, I have a love for startups and creative innovations. My elective Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Technology allowed me to connect with cutting-edge startup CEOs, VCs, and Angels which has helped me learn about the other side of the coin straight from the horse's mouth.

            I'm currently pursuing my  <LinkRefer link="https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/applicants/mse-ap/index.html">Master of Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University</LinkRefer>,
            and I'm looking for software development internships in challenging projects for summer 2020.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before coming to CMU, I was the Lead developer of Zerone Microsystems Private Limited, one of the four Indian startups selected for the Anthill Venturesâ€™ A- Scale program.
            The former KPMG CEO and former KPMG partner founded this firm. I worked on the core technology and led the development of several use - cases like an

            <LinkRefer link="http://conyct.com/vms"> visitor management web and mobile application</LinkRefer>,
            <LinkRefer link="http://zpi.cash"> payment exchange app</LinkRefer>.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my master's, I have been learning the fundamentals of software engineering complemented and what it truly means to create a scalable system from scratch.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from that, startups and innovations are very dear to me. My elective Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Technology allowed me to connect with cutting-edge startup CEOs, VCs, and angles and learn about the other side of the coin, straight from the horse's mouth.

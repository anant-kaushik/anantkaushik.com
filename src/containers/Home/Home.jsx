            I'm currently pursuing my  <LinkRefer link="https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/applicants/mse-ap/index.html">Master of Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University</LinkRefer>,
            and I'm looking for software development internships in challenging projects for summer 2020.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before joining CMU, I was the Lead developer at Zerone Microsystems Private Limited, one of the four Indian startups selected for the Anthill Venturesâ€™ A- Scale program which was founded by the team of a former KPMG CEO and Partner.
            I worked on the core technology and led the development of several use - cases which included an
            <LinkRefer link="http://conyct.com"> identity exchange app</LinkRefer>, and
            <LinkRefer link="http://conyct.com/vms"> visitor management web and mobile application</LinkRefer>,
            <LinkRefer link="http://zpi.cash"> payment exchange app</LinkRefer>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through my Master's, I am trying to learn the fundamentals of software engineering and what it truly means to create a scalable system from scratch.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from this, I have a love for startups and creative innovations. My elective Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Technology allowed me to connect with cutting-edge startup CEOs, VCs, and Angels which has helped me learn about the other side of the coin straight from the horse's mouth.
